/**
 * This checker is part of the "late error management" design choice of jPipe. A syntax error should
 * not prevent trying to render a model as an image, so that user can see visually where the error
 * is. As a consequence, one must collect errors, but let the process continue. With this checker,
 * we take a list of errors encountered in the previous steps. Is the list is not empty, we register
 * that the compilation will eventually fail, but let it continue to the next steps. It allows one
 * to render a model as an image even is the input file contains syntax errors.
 *
 * <p>
 *     The name is a reference to the HCF instruction in IBM System/360 (as well as good TV show).
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <T> type of model used at that point (only useful for chaining purpose).
